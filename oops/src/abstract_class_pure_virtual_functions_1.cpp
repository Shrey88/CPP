/*
 * Abstract class and Pure Virtual Functions
 * 
 * Abstract Class : we do no create an instance of the abstract class 
 *                  abstract class contains a method which have no implementation 
 *                  and we can say that pure virtual functions are pure virtual methods 
 *                  which have no implementation.
 * 
 * Pure Virtual Function : it does not have the implementation and syntax is 
 *                          virtual void fun_name()=0;
 *                          
 *                         class containing the pure virtual function is an abstract class.
