/*
	Let us assume an array arr[]. We need to check if all the numbers
	of an array can be equalized to a particular number. In a single
	operation, any element of the array can be either multiplied by 2 or
	by 3. If it's possible to make all the array elements equal with the
	given operation then print Yes else print No.

	Example:
		Input:
			3
			50 75 100
		Output:
			Yes ->{50 * 2 * 3, 75 * 2 * 2, 100 * 3} = {300, 300, 300}


		Input:
			2
			10 14
		Output:
			No
